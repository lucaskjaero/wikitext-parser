In a [[legal]] context, it may refer to the temporary suspension of a law to allow a legal challenge to be carried out.\n\nFor example, [[animal rights]] activists and [[Conservation movement|conservation]] authorities may request fishing or hunting moratoria to protect [[endangered]] or threatened animal species.  These delays, or suspensions, prevent people from hunting or fishing the animals in discussion.\n\nAnother instance is a delay of legal obligations or payment (\u0027\u0027[[debt moratorium]]\u0027\u0027). A legal official can order {{clarify|text\u003da delay of payment|date\u003dDecember 2015}} due to extenuating circumstances, which render one party incapable of paying another.\u003cref\u003e{{cite web|url\u003dhttp://dictionary.reference.com/browse/moratorium?s\u003dt|title\u003ddefinition of moratorium|author\u003ddictionary.com|work\u003ddictionary.com}}\u003c/ref\u003e\n\n\u003d\u003dSee also\u003d\u003d\n{{wiktionary|moratorium}}\n*[[Justice delayed is justice denied]]\n*[[2010 U.S. Deepwater Drilling Moratorium]]\n*[[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam]]\n*[[UN moratorium on the death penalty]]\n\n\u003d\u003dReferences\u003d\u003d\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{cite NIE|wstitle\u003dMoratorium|year\u003d1905}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Legal terminology]]\n\n\n{{Law-term-stub}}"}
