The [[Pioneer program|Pioneer]] missions obtained the first close-up images of Jupiter's atmosphere and several of its moons. They discovered that the radiation fields near the planet were much stronger than expected, but both spacecraft managed to survive in that environment. The trajectories of these spacecraft were used to refine the mass estimates of the Jovian system. [[Radio occultations]] by the planet resulted in better measurements of Jupiter's diameter and the amount of polar flattening.<ref name=\"burgess\" />{{rp|47}}<ref name=\"cosmology 101\">{{cite web |last=Lasher |first=Lawrence |date=August 1, 2006 |url=http://spaceprojects.arc.nasa.gov/Space_Projects/pioneer/PNhome.html |title=Pioneer Project Home Page |publisher=NASA Space Projects Division |access-date=November 28, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060101001205/http://spaceprojects.arc.nasa.gov/Space_Projects/pioneer/PNhome.html |archive-date=January 1, 2006 }}<\/ref>\n\nSix years later, the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] missions vastly improved the understanding of the [[Galilean moon]]s and discovered Jupiter's rings. They also confirmed that the Great Red Spot was anticyclonic. Comparison of images showed that the Spot had changed hue since the Pioneer missions, turning from orange to dark brown. A torus of ionized atoms was discovered along Io's orbital path, which were found to come from erupting volcanoes on the moon's surface.
