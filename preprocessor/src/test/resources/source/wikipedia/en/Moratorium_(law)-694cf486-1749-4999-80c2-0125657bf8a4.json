In a [[legal]] context, it may refer to the temporary suspension of a law to allow a legal challenge to be carried out.\n\nFor example, [[animal rights]] activists and [[Conservation movement|conservation]] authorities may request fishing or hunting moratoria to protect [[endangered]] or threatened animal species.  These delays, or suspensions, prevent people from hunting or fishing the animals in discussion.\n\nAnother instance is a delay of legal obligations or payment (''[[debt moratorium]]''). A legal official can order {{clarify|text=a delay of payment|date=December 2015}} due to extenuating circumstances, which render one party incapable of paying another.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/moratorium?s=t|title=definition of moratorium|author=dictionary.com|work=dictionary.com}}<\/ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{wiktionary|moratorium}}\n*[[Justice delayed is justice denied]]\n*[[2010 U.S. Deepwater Drilling Moratorium]]\n*[[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam]]\n*[[UN moratorium on the death penalty]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{cite NIE|wstitle=Moratorium|year=1905}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Legal terminology]]\n\n\n{{Law-term-stub}}",
