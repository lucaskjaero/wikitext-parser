The clickable coding treats the first object created in an area as the one on top.\n# - I've placed moons on \"top\" so that their smaller circles won't disappear \"under\" their respective planets or dwarf planets.\n#The \"poly\" code would be more appropriate for the moons of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. However, there appears to be a bug with that aspect of the code.\n# - I've compensated by using oversized circles for those moon groups, and tucking them UNDER their planets for now.\n#The Sun is a rectangle as that approximates the edge closely enough for the purposes of this template.\n#I've guessed as to the boundaries for the KB, SD, and OC - if they need adjustment, load the image into Paint and use the pencil tool to find the appropriate coordinates.\n<\/imagemap><noinclude>\n{{documentation}}\n<\/noinclude>",
