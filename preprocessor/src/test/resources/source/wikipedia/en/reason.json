The meaning of the word \"reason\" in senses such as \"human reason\" also overlaps to a large extent with \"[[rationality]]\" and the adjective of \"reason\" in philosophical contexts is normally \"[[Rationality|rational]]\", rather than \"reasoned\" or \"reasonable\".<ref>See [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rational Merriam Webster \"rational\"] and [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reasonable Merriam Webster \"reasonable\"].<\/ref> Some philosophers, [[Thomas Hobbes]] for example, also used the word '''ratiocination'''<!--boldface per [[WP:R#PLA]]--> as a synonym for \"reasoning\".\n\n==Philosophical history{{anchor|History_of_reasoning}}==\n[[File:Goya Caprichos3.jpg|thumb|[[Francisco de Goya]], ''[[The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters]]'' (''El sueño de la razón produce monstruos''), c. 1797]]\nThe proposal that reason gives humanity a special position in nature has been argued to be a defining characteristic of western [[philosophy]] and later western [[History of science#Modern science|modern science]], starting with classical Greece. Philosophy can be described as a way of life based upon reason, and in the other direction, reason has been one of the major subjects of philosophical discussion since ancient times. Reason is often said to be [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]], or \"self-correcting\", and the critique of reason has been a persistent theme in philosophy.<ref name=\"Jürgen Habermas 1990\">{{cite book |last1=Habermas |first1=Jürgen |author-link=Jürgen Habermas |title=The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=MIT Press |year=1990 }}<\/ref> It has been defined in different ways, at different times, by different thinkers about human nature.\n\n===Classical philosophy===\nFor many classical [[philosophers]], nature was understood [[teleology|teleologically]], meaning that every type of thing had a definitive purpose that fit within a natural order that was itself understood to have aims. Perhaps starting with [[Pythagoras]] or [[Heraclitus]], the cosmos is even said to have reason.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Presocratic Philosophers|edition=second|last1=Kirk|last2=Raven|last3=Schofield|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1983}}. See pp. 204 & 235.<\/ref> Reason, by this account, is not just one characteristic that humans happen to have, and that influences happiness amongst other characteristics. Reason was considered of higher stature than other characteristics of human nature, such as sociability, because it is something humans share with nature itself, linking an apparently immortal part of the human mind with the divine order of the cosmos itself. Within the human [[mind]] or [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (''[[psyche (psychology)|psyche]]''), reason was described by [[Plato]] as being the natural monarch which should rule over the other parts, such as spiritedness (''[[thumos]]'') and the passions. [[Aristotle]], Plato's student, defined human beings as [[rational animal]]s, emphasizing reason as a characteristic of [[human nature]]. He ''defined'' the highest human happiness or well being (''[[eudaimonia]]'') as a life which is lived consistently, excellently, and completely in accordance with reason.<ref>''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' [[Nicomachean Ethics#Defining Happiness and the aim of the Ethics|Book 1]].<\/ref>\n\nThe conclusions to be drawn from the discussions of Aristotle and Plato on this matter are amongst the most debated in the history of philosophy.<ref name=Davidson>{{Citation|title=Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, on Intellect|last=Davidson|first=Herbert|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992}}, p. 3.<\/ref> But teleological accounts such as Aristotle's were highly influential for those who attempt to explain reason in a way that is consistent with [[monotheism]] and the immortality and divinity of the human soul. For example, in the [[Neoplatonism|neoplatonist]] account of [[Plotinus]], the [[cosmos]] has one soul, which is the seat of all reason, and the souls of all individual humans are part of this soul. Reason is for Plotinus both the provider of form to material things, and the light which brings individuals souls back into line with their source.<ref>{{Citation|chapter=Plotinus|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|chapter-url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/plotinus/|last=Moore|first=Edward}}<\/ref>\n\n===Christian and Islamic philosophy===\n\nThe classical view of reason, like many important Neoplatonic and Stoic ideas, was readily adopted by the early Church <ref>{{Citation|chapter=Plato|title=Catholic Encyclopedia|chapter-url=https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12159a.htm}}<\/ref> as the Church Fathers saw Greek Philosophy as an indispensable instrument given to mankind so that we may understand revelation.<ref>{{Citation|chapter=Catholic Culture|title=Hellenism|chapter-url=https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/dictionary/index.cfm?id=33893}}<\/ref> For example, the greatest among the early saint [[Church Fathers]] and [[Doctors of the Church]] such as [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Basil of Caesarea]] and [[Gregory of Nyssa]] were as much Neoplatonic philosophers as they were Christian theologians and adopted the Neoplatonic view of human reason together with the associated implications for our relationship to creation, to ourselves and to God. Such Neoplatonist accounts of the rational part of the human soul were also standard amongst medieval Islamic philosophers and remain important in [[Iranian philosophy]].<ref name=Davidson/> As European intellectualism recovered from the post-Roman Dark Ages, the Christian [[Patristic]] heritage and the influence of the great Islamic scholars such as [[Averroes]] and [[Avicenna]] produced the Scholastic (see [[Scholasticism]]) view of reason from which our modern idea of this concept has developed.<ref>{{Citation|chapter=Reason|title=Catholic Encyclopedia|chapter-url=https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12673b.htm}}<\/ref> Among the Scholastics who relied on the classical concept of reason for the development of their doctrines, none were more influential than [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]], who put this concept at the heart of his [[Natural Law]]. In this doctrine, Thomas concludes that because humans have reason and because reason is a spark of the divine, every single human life is invaluable, all humans are equal and every human is born with an intrinsic and permanent set of basic rights.<ref>{{Citation|chapter=Natural Law|title=Catholic Encyclopedia|chapter-url=https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09076a.htm}}<\/ref> On this foundation, the idea of human rights would later be constructed by Spanish theologians at the [[School of Salamanca]]. Other Scholastics, such as [[Roger Bacon]] and [[Albertus Magnus]], following the example of Islamic scholars such as [[Alhazen]], emphasised reason an intrinsic human ability to decode the created order and the structures that underlie our experienced physical reality. This interpretation of reason was instrumental to the development of the scientific method in the early Universities of the high Middle Ages.<ref>{{Citation|chapter=Religion and Science|title=Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|year=2021|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|chapter-url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-science/}}<\/ref>\n\n===Subject-centred reason in early modern philosophy===\n\nThe [[early modern era]] was marked by a number of significant changes in the understanding of reason, starting in [[Europe]]. One of the most important of these changes involved a change in the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] understanding of human beings. Scientists and philosophers began to question the teleological understanding of the world.<ref>{{cite web |first=Hubert |last=Dreyfus |title=Telepistemology: Descartes' Last Stand |url=http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~hdreyfus/rtf/Limits_of_Telepresence_6_99.rtf |publisher= socrates.berkeley.edu |access-date= February 23, 2011}}<\/ref> Nature was no longer assumed to be human-like, with its own aims or reason, and human nature was no longer assumed to work according to anything other than the same \"[[natural law|laws of nature]]\" which affect inanimate things. This new understanding eventually displaced the previous [[world view]] that derived from a spiritual understanding of the universe.\n[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|200px|René Descartes]]\nAccordingly, in the 17th century, [[René Descartes]] explicitly rejected the traditional notion of humans as \"rational animals\", suggesting instead that they are nothing more than \"thinking things\" along the lines of other \"things\" in nature. Any grounds of knowledge outside that understanding was, therefore, subject to doubt.\n\nIn his search for a foundation of all possible knowledge, Descartes deliberately decided to throw into doubt ''all'' knowledge \u2013 ''except'' that of the mind itself in the process of thinking:\n\n<blockquote>At this time I admit nothing that is not necessarily true. I am therefore precisely nothing but a thinking thing; that is a mind, or intellect, or understanding, or reason \u2013 words of whose meanings I was previously ignorant.<ref>Descartes, \"Second Meditation\".<\/ref><\/blockquote>\n\nThis eventually became known as [[epistemological]] or \"subject-centred\" reason, because it is based on the ''knowing subject'', who perceives the rest of the world and itself as a set of objects to be studied, and successfully mastered by applying the knowledge accumulated through such study. Breaking with tradition and many thinkers after him, Descartes explicitly did not divide the incorporeal soul into parts, such as reason and intellect, describing them as one indivisible incorporeal entity.\n\nA contemporary of Descartes, [[Thomas Hobbes]] described reason as a broader version of \"addition and subtraction\" which is not limited to numbers.<ref>{{Citation|title=De Corpore|url=https://archive.org/details/englishworkstho21hobbgoog|last=Hobbes|first=Thomas|editor-last=Molesworth|publisher=London, J. Bohn|year=1839}}: \"We must not therefore think that computation, that is, ratiocination, has place only in numbers, as if man were distinguished from other living creatures (which is said to have been the opinion of ''[[Pythagoras]]'') by nothing but the faculty of numbering; for ''magnitude, body, motion, time, degrees of quality, action, conception, proportion, speech and names'' (in which all the kinds of philosophy consist) are capable of addition and substraction {{sic}}. Now such things as we add or substract, that is, which we put into an account, we are said to ''consider'', in Greek λογίζεσθαι [''logizesthai''], in which language also συλλογίζεσθι [''syllogizesthai''] signifies to ''compute'', ''reason'', or ''reckon''.\"<\/ref> This understanding of reason is sometimes termed \"calculative\" reason.

Therefore, suggested Kant, on the basis of such a self, it is in fact possible to reason both about the conditions and limits of human knowledge. And so long as these limits are respected, reason can be the vehicle of morality, justice, aesthetics, theories of knowledge ([[epistemology]]), and understanding.\n\n===Substantive and formal reason===\n\nIn the formulation of Kant, who wrote some of the most influential modern treatises on the subject, the great achievement of reason ({{lang-de|Vernunft}}) is that it is able to exercise a kind of universal law-making. Kant was able therefore to reformulate the basis of moral-practical, theoretical and aesthetic reasoning, on \"universal\" laws.\n\nHere [[practical reason]]ing is the self-legislating or self-governing formulation of universal [[norm (philosophy)|norms]], and [[theory|theoretical]] reasoning the way humans posit universal [[natural law|laws of nature]].<ref>Immanuel Kant, ''Critique of Pure Reason''; ''Critique of Practical Reason''.<\/ref>\n\nUnder practical reason, the moral [[autonomy]] or freedom of human beings depends on their ability to behave according to laws that are given to them by the proper exercise of that reason. This contrasted with earlier forms of morality, which depended on [[religion|religious understanding]] and interpretation, or [[nature]] for their substance.<ref>Michael Sandel, ''Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do?'', New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2009.<\/ref>\n\nAccording to Kant, in a free society each individual must be able to pursue their goals however they see fit, so long as their actions conform to principles given by reason. He formulated such a principle, called the \"[[categorical imperative]]\", which would justify an action only if it could be universalized:\n\n<blockquote>Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.<ref name=\"Ellington\">{{cite book|last1=Kant|first1=Immanuel|author-link=Immanuel Kant|author2=translated by James W.

Kant claimed that this problem could be solved with his \"[[transcendental logic]]\" which unlike normal logic is not just an instrument, which can be used indifferently, as it was for Aristotle, but a theoretical science in its own right and the basis of all the others.<ref>See {{Citation|last=Velkley|first=Richard|year=2002| chapter=On Kant's Socratism|title=Being After Rousseau|publisher=University of Chicago Press}} and Kant's own first preface to ''[[The Critique of Pure Reason]]''.<\/ref>\n\nAccording to [[Jürgen Habermas]], the \"substantive unity\" of reason has dissolved in modern times, such that it can no longer answer the question \"How should I live?\" Instead, the unity of reason has to be strictly formal, or \"procedural\". He thus described reason as a group of three autonomous spheres (on the model of Kant's three critiques):\n\n# ''Cognitive\u2013instrumental reason'' is the kind of reason employed by the sciences. It is used to observe events, to predict and control outcomes, and to intervene in the world on the basis of its hypotheses;\n# ''Moral\u2013practical reason'' is what we use to deliberate and discuss issues in the moral and political realm, according to universalizable procedures (similar to Kant's categorical imperative); and\n# ''Aesthetic reason'' is typically found in works of art and literature, and encompasses the novel ways of seeing the world and interpreting things that those practices embody.\n\nFor Habermas, these three spheres are the domain of experts, and therefore need to be mediated with the \"[[lifeworld]]\" by philosophers. In drawing such a picture of reason, Habermas hoped to demonstrate that the substantive unity of reason, which in pre-modern societies had been able to answer questions about the good life, could be made up for by the unity of reason's formalizable procedures.<ref>Jürgen Habermas, ''Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action'', Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1995.<\/ref>\n\n===The critique of reason===\n\n[[Johann Georg Hamann|Hamann]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Richard Rorty|Rorty]], and many other philosophers have contributed to a debate about what reason means, or ought to mean. Some, like Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Rorty, are skeptical about subject-centred, universal, or instrumental reason, and even skeptical toward reason as a whole. Others, including Hegel, believe that it has obscured the importance of [[intersubjectivity]], or \"spirit\" in human life, and attempt to reconstruct a model of what reason should be.\n\nSome thinkers, e.g. Foucault, believe there are other ''forms'' of reason, neglected but essential to modern life, and to our understanding of what it means to live a life according to reason.<ref name=\"Jürgen Habermas 1990\"/>\n\nIn the last several decades, a number of proposals have been made to \"re-orient\" this critique of reason, or to recognize the \"other voices\" or \"new departments\" of reason:\n\nFor example, in opposition to subject-centred reason, Habermas has proposed a model of [[communicative rationality|communicative reason]] that sees it as an essentially cooperative activity, based on the fact of linguistic [[intersubjectivity]].<ref>Jürgen Habermas, ''The Theory of Communicative Action: Reason and the Rationalization of Society'', translated by Thomas McCarthy.

This distinction, as suggested, has two dimensions:\n* ''Private reason'' is the reason that is used when an individual is \"a cog in a machine\" or when one \"has a role to play in society and jobs to do: to be a soldier, to have taxes to pay, to be in charge of a parish, to be a civil servant\".\n* ''Public reason'' is the reason used \"when one is reasoning as a reasonable being (and not as a cog in a machine), when one is reasoning as a member of reasonable humanity\".

A dog once kicked, can learn how to recognize the warning signs and avoid being kicked in the future, but this does not mean the dog has reason in any strict sense of the word. It also does not mean that humans acting on the basis of experience or habit are using their reason.<ref>See the [[Treatise of Human Nature]] of [[David Hume]], [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=342&chapter=55113&layout=html&Itemid=27 Book I, Part III, Sect. XVI].<\/ref>\n\nHuman reason requires more than being able to associate two ideas, even if those two ideas might be described by a reasoning human as a cause and an effect, perceptions of smoke, for example, and memories of fire. For reason to be involved, the association of smoke and the fire would have to be thought through in a way which can be explained, for example as cause and effect. In the explanation of [[John Locke|Locke]], for example, reason requires the mental use of a third idea in order to make this comparison by use of [[syllogism]].<ref>{{Citation|first=John|last=Locke|volume= 2|chapter=XVII Of Reason|orig-year=1689|chapter-url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=762&layout=html#chapter_80842|edition=12th|year=1824|publisher=Rivington|series =The Works of John Locke in Nine Volumes|title=An Essay concerning Human Understanding Part 2 and Other Writings}}<\/ref>\n\nMore generally, reason in the strict sense requires the ability to create and manipulate a system of [[symbol]]s, as well as [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#II. Icon, index, symbol|indices and icons]], according to [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], the symbols having only a nominal, though habitual, connection to either smoke or fire.<ref>Terrence Deacon, ''The Symbolic Species: The Co-Evolution of Language and the Brain'', W.W. Norton & Company, 1998, {{ISBN|0-393-31754-4}}<\/ref> One example of such a system of artificial symbols and signs is [[language]].\n\nThe connection of reason to symbolic thinking has been expressed in different ways by philosophers. [[Thomas Hobbes]] described the creation of \"Markes, or Notes of remembrance\" (''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' Ch. 4) as ''speech''. He used the word ''speech'' as an English version of the Greek word ''[[logos]]'' so that speech did not need to be communicated.<ref>[http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-a.html#CHAPTERIV Leviathan Chapter IV] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615025735/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-a.html |date=2006-06-15 }}: \"The Greeks have but one word, logos, for both speech and reason; not that they thought there was no speech without reason, but no reasoning without speech\"<\/ref> When communicated, such speech becomes language, and the marks or notes or remembrance are called \"[[Sign (linguistics)|Signes]]\" by Hobbes. Going further back, although Aristotle is a source of the idea that only humans have reason (''logos''), he does mention that animals with imagination, for whom sense perceptions can persist, come closest to having something like reasoning and ''[[nous]]'', and even uses the word \"logos\" in one place to describe the distinctions which animals can perceive in such cases.<ref>''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' II.19.<\/ref>\n\n===Reason, imagination, mimesis, and memory===\n{{Main|Imagination|Mimesis|Memory|Recollection}}\nReason and [[imagination]] rely on similar [[mental processes]].<ref>See for example [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]] (2005). ''The Rational Imagination: How People Create Counterfactual Alternatives to Reality.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.<\/ref> Imagination is not only found in humans. Aristotle, for example, stated that ''phantasia'' (imagination: that which can hold images or ''phantasmata'') and ''phronein'' (a type of thinking that can judge and understand in some sense) also exist in some animals.<ref>''[[De Anima]]'' III.i\u2013iii; ''On Memory and Recollection'', ''On Dreams''<\/ref> According to him, both are related to the primary perceptive ability of animals, which gathers the perceptions of different senses and defines the order of the things that are perceived without distinguishing universals, and without deliberation or ''logos''. But this is not yet reason, because human imagination is different.\n\nThe recent modern writings of [[Terrence Deacon]] and [[Merlin Donald]], writing about the [[origin of language]], also connect reason connected to not only [[language]], but also [[mimesis]].<ref>Mimesis in modern academic writing, starting with [[Erich Auerbach]], is a technical word, which is not necessarily exactly the same in meaning as the original Greek. See [[Mimesis]].<\/ref> More specifically they describe the ability to create [[language]] as part of an internal modeling of [[reality]] specific to humankind. Other results are [[consciousness]], and [[imagination]] or [[fantasy]]. In contrast, modern proponents of a genetic predisposition to language itself include [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Steven Pinker]], to whom Donald and Deacon can be contrasted.\n\nAs reason is symbolic thinking, and peculiarly human, then this implies that humans have a special ability to maintain a clear consciousness of the distinctness of \"icons\" or images and the real things they represent. Starting with a modern author, Merlin Donald writes<ref>Origins of the Modern Mind p. 172<\/ref>\n<blockquote>A dog might perceive the \"meaning\" of a fight that was realistically play-acted by humans, but it could not reconstruct the message or distinguish the representation from its referent (a real fight). [...] Trained apes are able to make this distinction; young children make this distinction early \u2013 hence, their effortless distinction between play-acting an event and the event itself<\/blockquote>\n\nIn classical descriptions, an equivalent description of this mental faculty is ''eikasia'', in the philosophy of Plato.<ref>Jacob Klein ''A Commentary on the [[Meno]]'' Ch.5<\/ref> This is the ability to perceive whether a perception is an image of something else, related somehow but not the same, and therefore allows humans to perceive that a dream or memory or a reflection in a mirror is not reality as such. What Klein refers to as ''dianoetic eikasia'' is the ''eikasia'' concerned specifically with thinking and mental images, such as those mental symbols, icons, ''signes'', and marks discussed above as definitive of reason. Explaining reason from this direction: human thinking is special in the way that we often understand visible things as if they were themselves images of our intelligible \"objects of thought\" as \"foundations\" (''hypothēses'' in Ancient Greek). This thinking (''dianoia'') is \"...an activity which consists in making the vast and diffuse jungle of the visible world depend on a plurality of more 'precise' ''noēta''\".<ref>Jacob Klein ''A Commentary on the Meno'' p. 122<\/ref>\n\nBoth Merlin Donald and the Socratic authors such as Plato and Aristotle emphasize the importance of ''mimesis'', often translated as ''imitation'' or ''representation''. Donald writes<ref>Origins of the Modern Mind p. 169<\/ref>\n<blockquote>Imitation is found especially in monkeys and apes [... but ...] Mimesis is fundamentally different from imitation and mimicry in that it involves the invention of intentional representations. [...] Mimesis is not absolutely tied to external communication.<\/blockquote>\n\n''Mimēsis'' is a concept, now popular again in academic discussion, that was particularly prevalent in Plato's works, and within Aristotle, it is discussed mainly in the ''Poetics''. In Michael Davis's account of the theory of man in this work.<ref>\"Introduction\" to the translation of ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' by Davis and [[Seth Benardete]] p. xvii, xxviii<\/ref>\n<blockquote>It is the distinctive feature of human action, that whenever we choose what we do, we imagine an action for ourselves as though we were inspecting it from the outside. Intentions are nothing more than imagined actions, internalizings of the external. All action is therefore imitation of action; it is poetic...<ref>Davis is here using \"poetic\" in an unusual sense, questioning the contrast in Aristotle between action (''praxis'', the ''praktikē'') and making (''poēsis'', the ''poētikē''): \"Human [peculiarly human] action is imitation of action because thinking is always rethinking. Aristotle can define human beings as at once rational animals, political animals, and imitative animals because in the end the three are the same.\"<\/ref><\/blockquote>\n\nDonald like Plato (and Aristotle, especially in ''On Memory and Recollection''), emphasizes the peculiarity in humans of voluntary initiation of a search through one's mental world. The ancient Greek ''anamnēsis'', normally translated as \"recollection\" was opposed to ''mneme'' or ''memory''. Memory, shared with some animals,<ref>Aristotle [[On Memory]] 450a 15\u201316.<\/ref> requires a consciousness not only of what happened in the past, but also ''that'' something happened in the past, which is in other words a kind of ''eikasia''<ref>Jacob Klein ''A Commentary on the Meno'' p. 109<\/ref> \"...but nothing except man is able to recollect.\"<ref>Aristotle Hist. Anim. I.1.488b.25\u201326.<\/ref> Recollection is a deliberate effort to search for and recapture something once known. Klein writes that, \"To become aware of our having forgotten something means to begin recollecting.\"<ref>Jacob Klein ''A Commentary on the Meno'' p. 112<\/ref> Donald calls the same thing ''autocueing'', which he explains as follows:<ref>''The Origins of the Modern Mind'' p. 173 see also ''A Mind So Rare'' pp. 140\u2013141<\/ref> \"Mimetic acts are reproducible on the basis of internal, self-generated cues. This permits voluntary recall of mimetic representations, without the aid of external cues \u2013 probably the earliest form of representational ''thinking''.\"\n\nIn a celebrated paper in modern times, the fantasy author and philologist [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote in his essay \"On Fairy Stories\" that the terms \"fantasy\" and \"enchantment\" are connected to not only \"....the satisfaction of certain primordial human desires....\" but also \"...the origin of language and of the mind\".\n\n===Logical reasoning methods and argumentation===\nA subdivision of [[philosophy]] is [[logic]]. Logic is the study of reasoning.  Looking at logical categorizations of different types of reasoning, the traditional main division made in philosophy is between [[deductive reasoning]] and [[inductive reasoning]]. [[Logic|Formal logic]] has been described as ''the science of deduction''.<ref>Jeffrey, Richard. 1991. ''Formal logic: its scope and limits'', (3rd ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill:1.<\/ref> The study of inductive reasoning is generally carried out within the field known as [[informal logic]] or [[critical thinking]].\n\n====Deductive reasoning====\n{{Main|Deductive reasoning}}\nDeduction is a form of reasoning in which a conclusion follows necessarily from the stated premises. A deduction is also the conclusion reached by a deductive reasoning process.  One classic example of deductive reasoning is that found in [[syllogism]]s like the following:\n* Premise 1: All humans are mortal.\n* Premise 2: Socrates is a human.\n* Conclusion: Socrates is mortal.\n\nThe reasoning in this argument is deductively [[Validity (logic)|valid]] because there is no way in which the premises, 1 and 2, could be true and the conclusion, 3, be false.\n\n====Inductive reasoning====\n{{Main|Inductive reasoning}}\nInduction is a form of inference producing propositions about unobserved objects or types, either specifically or generally, based on previous observation. It is used to ascribe [[category of being|properties or relations]] to objects or [[type (metaphysics)|types]] based on [[event (philosophy)|previous observations or experiences]], or to formulate general statements or [[law (principle)|laws]] based on limited observations of recurring [[phenomena]]l patterns.\n\nInductive reasoning contrasts strongly with deductive reasoning in that, even in the best, or strongest, cases of inductive reasoning, the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Instead, the conclusion of an inductive argument follows with some degree of [[probability]]. Relatedly, the conclusion of an inductive argument contains more information than is already contained in the premises. Thus, this method of reasoning is ampliative.\n\nA classic example of inductive reasoning comes from the [[empiricist]] [[David Hume]]:\n* Premise: The sun has risen in the east every morning up until now.\n* Conclusion: The sun will also rise in the east tomorrow.\n\n====Analogical reasoning====\n{{Main|Analogical reasoning}}\nAnalogical reasoning is a form of inductive reasoning from a particular to a particular. It is often used in [[case-based reasoning]], especially legal reasoning.<ref>{{cite book |last=Walton |first=Douglas N. |author-link=Douglas N. Walton |date=2014 |chapter=Argumentation schemes for argument from analogy |editor-last=Ribeiro |editor-first=Henrique Jales |title=Systematic approaches to argument by analogy |series=Argumentation library |volume=25 |location=Cham; New York |publisher=[[Springer Verlag]] |pages=23\u201340 |isbn=978-3-319-06333-1 |oclc=884441074 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-06334-8_2|chapter-url=https://scholar.uwindsor.ca/crrarpub/15 }}<\/ref> An example follows:\n* Premise 1: Socrates is human and mortal.\n* Premise 2: Plato is human.\n* Conclusion: Plato is mortal.\n\nAnalogical reasoning is a weaker form of inductive reasoning from a single example, because inductive reasoning typically uses a large number of examples to reason from the particular to the general.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Vickers |first=John |title=The Problem of Induction |encyclopedia= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |year=2009 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/ |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University }}<\/ref> Analogical reasoning often leads to wrong conclusions. For example:\n* Premise 1: Socrates is human and male.\n* Premise 2: [[Ada Lovelace]] is human.\n* Conclusion: Ada Lovelace is male.\n\n====Abductive reasoning====\n{{Main|Abductive reasoning}}\nAbductive reasoning, or argument to the best explanation, is a form of reasoning that doesn't fit in deductive or inductive, since it starts with incomplete set of observations and proceeds with likely possible explanations so the conclusion in an abductive argument does not follow with certainty from its premises and concerns something unobserved. What distinguishes abduction from the other forms of reasoning is an attempt to favour one conclusion above others, by subjective judgement or attempting to falsify alternative explanations or by demonstrating the likelihood of the favoured conclusion, given a set of more or less disputable assumptions. For example, when a patient displays certain symptoms, there might be various possible causes, but one of these is preferred above others as being more probable.\n\n====Fallacious reasoning====\n{{Main|Fallacy|Formal fallacy|Informal fallacy}}\nFlawed reasoning in arguments is known as [[fallacy|fallacious reasoning]]. Bad reasoning within arguments can be because it commits either a [[formal fallacy]] or an [[informal fallacy]].\n\nFormal fallacies occur when there is a problem with the form, or structure, of the argument. The word \"formal\" refers to this link to the ''form'' of the argument. An argument that contains a formal fallacy will always be invalid.\n\nAn informal fallacy is an error in reasoning that occurs due to a problem with the ''content'', rather than mere ''structure'', of the argument.\n\n==Traditional problems raised concerning reason==\nPhilosophy is sometimes described as a life of reason, with normal human reason pursued in a more consistent and dedicated way than usual. Two categories of problem concerning reason have long been discussed by philosophers concerning reason, essentially being reasonings about reasoning itself as a human aim, or philosophizing about philosophizing. The first question is concerning whether we can be confident that reason can achieve [[knowledge]] of [[truth]] better than other ways of trying to achieve such knowledge. The other question is whether a life of reason, a life that aims to be guided by reason, can be expected to achieve a [[eudaimonia|happy life]] more so than other ways of life (whether such a life of reason results in knowledge or not).\n\n===Reason versus truth, and \"first principles\"===\n{{See also|Truth|First principle|Nous}}\nSince [[classical antiquity|classical]] times a question has remained constant in philosophical debate (which is sometimes seen as a conflict between movements called [[Platonism]] and [[Aristotelianism]]) concerning the role of reason in confirming [[truth]]. People use logic, [[deductive reasoning|deduction]], and [[inductive reasoning|induction]], to reach conclusions they think are true. Conclusions reached in this way are considered, according to Aristotle, more certain than sense perceptions on their own.<ref>Example: Aristotle ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D981b 981b]: τὴν ὀνομαζομένην σοφίαν περὶ τὰ πρῶτα αἴτια καὶ τὰς ἀρχὰς ὑπολαμβάνουσι πάντες: ὥστε, καθάπερ εἴρηται πρότερον, ὁ μὲν ἔμπειρος τῶν ὁποιανοῦν ἐχόντων αἴσθησιν εἶναι δοκεῖ σοφώτερος, ὁ δὲ τεχνίτης τῶν ἐμπείρων, χειροτέχνου δὲ ἀρχιτέκτων, αἱ δὲ θεωρητικαὶ τῶν ποιητικῶν μᾶλλον.

For example in ''Metaphysics'' 1009b, cited above, he criticizes people who think knowledge might not be possible because, \"They say that the impression given through sense-perception is necessarily true; for it is on these grounds that both [[Empedocles]] and Democritus and practically all the rest have become obsessed by such opinions as these.\"<\/ref> but more correctly associated with [[Great Britain|British]] philosophers such as [[John Locke]] and [[David Hume]], as well as their ancient equivalents such as [[Democritus]]) asserts that sensory impressions are the only available starting points for reasoning and attempting to attain truth. This approach always leads to the controversial conclusion that [[absolute knowledge]] is not attainable. [[Idealism]], (associated with Plato and his school), claims that there is a \"higher\" reality, from which certain people can directly arrive at truth without needing to rely only upon the senses, and that this higher reality is therefore the primary source of truth.\n\nPhilosophers such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], [[Averroes]], [[Maimonides]], [[Aquinas]] and [[Hegel]] are sometimes said to have argued that reason must be fixed and discoverable\u2014perhaps by dialectic, analysis, or study. In the vision of these thinkers, reason is divine or at least has divine attributes. Such an approach allowed religious philosophers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Étienne Gilson]] to try to show that reason and [[revelation]] are compatible. According to Hegel, \"...the only thought which Philosophy brings with it to the contemplation of [[History]], is the simple conception of reason; that reason is the Sovereign of the World; that the history of the world, therefore, presents us with a rational process.\"<ref>G.W.F.

For [[Descartes]], [[Spinoza]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], this was associated with [[mathematics]]. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] attempted to show that pure reason could form concepts ([[time]] and [[space]]) that are the conditions of experience.

Imagination, Origins: Rousseau and the Political Animal|title=Being after Rousseau: Philosophy and Culture in Question|year=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}<\/ref> He asked what really can be said about what is natural to mankind. What, other than reason and civil society, \"best suits his constitution\"? Rousseau saw \"two principles prior to reason\" in human nature. First we hold an intense interest in our own well-being. Secondly we object to the suffering or death of any sentient being, especially one like ourselves.<ref>{{Citation|last=Rousseau|chapter=Preface|title=Discourse on the Origin and Foundations of Inequality Among Men or Second Discourse|publisher=Cambridge University Press|editor=Gourevitch|year=1997}}<\/ref> These two passions lead us to desire more than we could achieve. We become dependent upon each other, and on relationships of authority and obedience. This effectively puts the human race into slavery. Rousseau says that he almost dares to assert that nature does not destine men to be healthy. According to [[Richard Velkley]], \"Rousseau outlines certain programs of rational self-correction, most notably the political legislation of the ''[[The Social Contract|Contrat Social]]'' and the moral education in ''[[Emile: or, On Education|Émile]]''. All the same, Rousseau understands such corrections to be only ameliorations of an essentially unsatisfactory condition, that of socially and intellectually corrupted humanity.\"\n\nThis quandary presented by Rousseau led to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s new way of justifying reason as freedom to create good and evil. These therefore are not to be blamed on nature or God. In various ways,  [[German Idealism]] after Kant, and major later figures such [[Nietzsche]], [[Bergson]], [[Husserl]], [[Max Scheler|Scheler]], and [[Heidegger]], remain preoccupied with problems coming from the metaphysical demands or ''urges'' of ''reason''.<ref>{{Citation|last=Velkley|first=Richard|chapter=Freedom, Teleology, and Justification of Reason|title=Being after Rousseau: Philosophy and Culture in Question|year=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}<\/ref> The influence of Rousseau and these later writers is also large upon art and politics. Many writers (such as [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]) extol passion and disparage reason. In politics modern [[nationalism]] comes from Rousseau's argument that rationalist [[cosmopolitanism]] brings man ever further from his natural state.<ref>{{Citation|chapter=Rousseau and the Origins of Nationalism|last=Plattner|first=Marc|year=1997|publisher=University of Chicago Press|title=The Legacy of Rousseau}}<\/ref>\n\nAnother view on reason and emotion was proposed in the 1994 book titled ''[[Descartes' Error]]'' by [[Antonio Damasio]]. In it, Damasio presents the \"[[Somatic marker hypothesis|Somatic Marker Hypothesis]]\" which states that emotions guide behavior and decision-making. Damasio argues that these somatic markers (known collectively as \"gut feelings\") are \"intuitive signals\" that direct our decision making processes in a certain way that cannot be solved with rationality alone. Damasio further argues that rationality requires emotional input in order to function.\n\n===Reason versus faith or tradition===\n{{Main|Faith|Religion|Tradition}}\nThere are many religious traditions, some of which are explicitly [[Fideism|fideist]] and others of which claim varying degrees of [[rationalism]].

French social and cognitive scientists [[Dan Sperber]] and Hugo Mercier argue that there could have been other forces driving the evolution of reason.

Reasoning is most effective when it is done as a collective \u2013 as demonstrated by the success of projects like [[science]]. They suggest that there are not just individual, but [[group selection]] pressures at play. Any group that managed to find ways of reasoning effectively would reap benefits for all its members, increasing their [[fitness (biology)|fitness]].

For example...\n<blockquote>It is clear, then, that a human being is more of a political [''politikon'' = of the ''polis''] animal [''zōion''] than is any bee or than any of those animals that live in herds. For nature, as we say, makes nothing in vain, and humans are the only animals who possess reasoned speech [''logos'']. Voice, of course, serves to indicate what is painful and pleasant; that is why it is also found in other animals, because their nature has reached the point where they can perceive what is painful and pleasant and express these to each other. But speech [''logos''] serves to make plain what is advantageous and harmful and so also what is just and unjust. For it is a peculiarity of humans, in contrast to the other animals, to have perception of good and bad, just and unjust, and the like; and the community in these things makes a household or city [''polis'']. [...] By nature, then, the drive for such a community exists in everyone, but the first to set one up is responsible for things of very great goodness. For as humans are the best of all animals when perfected, so they are the worst when divorced from law and right. The reason is that injustice is most difficult to deal with when furnished with weapons, and the weapons a human being has are meant by nature to go along with prudence and virtue, but it is only too possible to turn them to contrary uses. Consequently, if a human being lacks virtue, he is the most unholy and savage thing, and when it comes to sex and food, the worst. But justice is something political [to do with the ''polis''], for right is the arrangement of the political community, and right is discrimination of what is just. ([[Aristotle's Politics]] 1253a 1.2.

This argument has remained a central argument in all political, ethical and moral thinking since then, and has become especially controversial since firstly [[Rousseau]]'s Second Discourse, and secondly, the [[Theory of Evolution]]. Already in Aristotle there was an awareness that the ''polis'' had not always existed and had needed to be invented or developed by humans themselves. The household came first, and the first villages and cities were just extensions of that, with the first cities being run as if they were still families with Kings acting like fathers.<ref>Politics I.2.1252b15<\/ref>\n<blockquote>[[Friendship]] [''philia''] seems to prevail [in] man and woman according to [[nature]] [''kata phusin'']; for people are by nature [''tēi phusei''] pairing [''sunduastikon''] more than political [''politikon'' = of the ''polis''], in as much as the household [''oikos''] is prior [''proteron'' = earlier] and more necessary than the ''polis'' and making children is more common [''koinoteron''] with the animals. In the other animals, community [''koinōnia''] goes no further than this, but people live together [''sumoikousin''] not only for the sake of making children, but also for the things for life; for from the start the functions [''erga''] are divided, and are different [for] man and woman. Thus they supply each other, putting their own into the common [''eis to koinon'']. It is for these [reasons] that both utility [''chrēsimon''] and pleasure [''hēdu''] seem to be found in this kind of friendship. ([[Nicomachean Ethics]], VIII.12.1162a. Rough literal translation with Greek terms shown in square brackets.)<\/blockquote>\n\n[[Rousseau]] in his Second Discourse finally took the shocking step of claiming that this traditional account has things in reverse: with reason, language and rationally organized communities all having developed over a long period of time merely as a result of the fact that some habits of cooperation were found to solve certain types of problems, and that once such cooperation became more important, it forced people to develop increasingly complex cooperation\u2014often only to defend themselves from each other.\n\nIn other words, according to Rousseau, reason, language and rational community did not arise because of any conscious decision or plan by humans or gods, nor because of any pre-existing human nature. As a result, he claimed, living together in rationally organized communities like modern humans is a development with many negative aspects compared to the original state of man as an ape. If anything is specifically human in this theory, it is the flexibility and adaptability of humans. This view of the animal origins of distinctive human characteristics later received support from [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[Theory of Evolution]].\n\nThe two competing theories concerning the origins of reason are relevant to political and ethical thought because, according to the Aristotelian theory, a best way of living together exists independently of historical circumstances. According to Rousseau, we should even doubt that reason, language and politics are a good thing, as opposed to being simply the best option given the particular course of events that lead to today. Rousseau's theory, that human nature is malleable rather than fixed, is often taken to imply, for example by [[Karl Marx]], a wider range of possible ways of living together than traditionally known.\n\nHowever, while Rousseau's initial impact encouraged bloody revolutions against traditional politics, including both the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], his own conclusions about the best forms of community seem to have been remarkably classical, in favor of city-states such as [[Geneva]], and [[Arcadia (utopia)|rural living]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philosophy|Psychology}}\n* [[Argument]]\n* [[Argumentation theory]]\n* [[Confirmation bias]]\n* [[Conformity]]\n* [[Critical thinking]]\n* [[Logic and rationality]]\n* [[Outline of thought]] \u2013 topic tree that identifies many types of thoughts/thinking, types of reasoning, aspects of thought, related fields, and more.\n* [[Outline of human intelligence]] \u2013 topic tree presenting the traits, capacities, models, and research fields of human intelligence, and more.\n* [[Common sense]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Wiktionary|reason}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{PhilPapers|category|reasoning}}\n* Beer, Francis A., \"Words of Reason\", ''Political Communication'' 11 (Summer, 1994): 185\u2013201.\n* {{citation |year=1991 |author=Gilovich, Thomas |author-link=Thomas Gilovich |title=How We Know What Isn't So: The Fallibility of Human Reason in Everyday Life |place=New York |publisher=The [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] |isbn=978-0-02-911705-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/howweknowwhatisn00gilorich }}\n\n{{Age of Enlightenment}}\n{{Human intelligence topics}}\n{{Logic}}\n{{Philosophical logic}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Reasoning| ]]\n[[Category:Age of Enlightenment]]\n[[Category:Cognition]]\n[[Category:Concepts in epistemology]]\n[[Category:Concepts in ethics]]\n[[Category:Concepts in logic]]\n[[Category:Concepts in metaphilosophy]]\n[[Category:Concepts in the philosophy of mind]]\n[[Category:Concepts in the philosophy of science]]\n[[Category:Critical thinking]]\n[[Category:Idealism]]\n[[Category:Knowledge]]\n[[Category:Metaphysics of mind]]\n[[Category:Ontology]]\n[[Category:Philosophical logic]]\n[[Category:Philosophy of logic]]\n[[Category:Problem solving skills]]\n[[Category:Rationalism]]\n[[Category:Truth]]\n[[Category:Virtue]]",
